# TaskBubble 🫧

**TaskBubble** is a simple and visually pleasing productivity app for macOS. I’ve been working on Task Bubble, a Swift-based productivity app that’s a passion project born from my desire to stay organized and manage my time, goals, and priorities more effectively (because who doesn’t need some extra support staying on top of tasks?). This desktop app integrates an AI chatbot designed to help users prioritize and streamline their to-do lists, making it easier to focus on what truly matters. Building this tool has deepened my appreciation for user-focused design and showcases my ability to merge AI with practical applications, demonstrating how NLP can simplify complex workflows and enhance usability.
